# Event Manager
Platform to aggregate, enrich, and correlate events.

## Project Requirements
 - Provide a framework to incorporate custom logic. Most features could be provided as seperate "blocks" of custom logic, allowing for them to be mixed and matched based on needs.
 - API-first, any UI should be 100% independant.
 - Actions/events should be centralized in a messaging system. This allows for mirrored deployments, archiving, and auditing.
